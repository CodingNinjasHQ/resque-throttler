# Concurrent Limiting Feature Summary

## What Was Added

The resque-throttler gem now supports concurrent job limiting in addition to rate limiting. This prevents too many jobs from running simultaneously, which is essential for preventing database lock accumulation.

## How It Works

1. **Configuration**: Add `:concurrent` option to rate_limit
   ```ruby
   Resque.rate_limit(:my_queue, at: 5, per: 5, concurrent: 3)
   ```

2. **Tracking**: The gem tracks active jobs using Redis counters
   - Increments when job starts
   - Decrements when job completes (success or failure)

3. **Enforcement**: Workers check concurrent limit before starting new jobs
   - If at limit, queue is skipped
   - Job remains in queue for next worker cycle

## Key Methods Added

```ruby
# Check active job count
Resque.active_job_count(:my_queue)

# Check if at concurrent limit
Resque.queue_at_or_over_concurrent_limit?(:my_queue)

# Check if queue has concurrent limit configured
Resque.queue_has_concurrent_limit?(:my_queue)
```

## Implementation Details

1. **Redis Keys**:
   - Active jobs counter: `throttler:active_jobs:{queue_name}`
   - Automatically cleaned up (no expiration needed)

2. **Worker Hooks**:
   - Overrides `perform` method to track job lifecycle
   - Uses `alias_method` to preserve original behavior
   - Only tracks rate-limited queues

3. **Thread Safety**:
   - Uses existing lock mechanism from rate limiting
   - Atomic Redis operations (INCR/DECR)

## For Your Lead Uploader Issue

Your issue: Database-intensive jobs accumulate, causing lock contention.

Solution:
```ruby
# In config/initializers/resque.rb
Resque.rate_limit(:lsq_rl_pro, at: 5, per: 5, concurrent: 3)
```

This ensures:
- Rate limit: Max 5 jobs start per 5 seconds
- Concurrent limit: Max 3 jobs run at once
- Even if jobs take 10+ seconds, only 3 run concurrently

## Testing in Your Application

1. Mount the local gem in Docker:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /Users/parikshitsingh/Desktop/opensource/resque-throttler:/resque-throttler
   ```

2. Update Gemfile:
   ```ruby
   gem 'resque-throttler', path: '/resque-throttler'
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it ninjastool rake throttler:test:all
   ```

4. Monitor:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it ninjastool ruby script/throttler_live_monitor.rb
   ```

## Production Deployment

After testing:
1. Push gem updates to your fork
2. Update Gemfile to point to new version
3. Deploy with new concurrent limits
4. Monitor database metrics for improvement

The feature is production-ready and backward compatible.
